## How Claude Code Uses This File

**At session start:** Read the most recent entry. It tells you:
- What was last completed
- What decisions were made that affect your work
- Any known issues or open items
- What to build next

**At session end:** Append a new entry using the template below. Be specific — your future self is the audience.

## Entry Template

Copy this block and fill it in at the end of every session:

```

## Session [NUMBER] — [DATE]

### What Was Built
[1-3 sentences describing what feature or part of a feature was completed]

### Feature Reference
Feature: [Feature name and number from feature_list.md]
Status: [Complete / Partial — describe what remains if partial]

### Files Created or Modified
- [filepath] — [what changed]
- [filepath] — [what changed]

### Database Changes
- [Table created/modified] — [what changed and why]
- Migration file: [filename]

### Decisions Made
[Any choices made that deviate from or extend the feature list or schema — explain the why]
- Decision: [what was decided]
  Reason: [why]

### Deviations From Plan
[Anything that differs from feature_list.md, database_schema.md, or claude_rules.md]
- None  (or describe each deviation)

### Known Issues / Open Items
[Anything incomplete, broken, or needing follow-up]
- None  (or describe each issue with severity: low / medium / high)

### Environment Variables Added
[Any new variables added — add placeholders to .env.example]
- None  (or list each: VARIABLE_NAME — purpose)

### What To Do Next Session
[Specific instruction for the next session — be precise]
Next: Build [Feature X] — start with [specific file or migration or component]

### Definition of Done Status
[List any DoD items that were N/A and why]
- [Item] — N/A because [reason]

## Session 0 — Project Kickoff

### What Was Built
Project documentation created. No application code written yet.

### Feature Reference
Feature: N/A — pre-build setup
Status: Complete

### Files Created or Modified
- `claude_rules.md` — full project rules and tech stack constraints
- `feature_list.md` — complete tiered feature list for MVP, Post-MVP, and Future
- `database_schema.md` — full data model with all tables, indexes, RLS policies, and migration order
- `definition_of_done.md` — checklist Claude Code must satisfy before marking a feature complete
- `build_log.md` — this file

### Database Changes
- None — no migrations written yet

### Decisions Made
- Decision: Org hierarchy is Organization → Teams → Members (not flat)
  Reason: Supports county-level customers with multiple units without a data model rewrite later
- Decision: `incident_personnel` is a single table covering both org members and unaffiliated QR volunteers
  Reason: ICS 211 needs one authoritative source regardless of how someone checked in
- Decision: JSONB for `ics_forms.form_data` instead of per-form tables
  Reason: Each form type has a different field set; JSONB avoids a table explosion while remaining queryable
- Decision: `subscriptions` mirror table instead of live Stripe queries
  Reason: Avoids Stripe API latency and failure risk on every feature-gated page load
- Decision: Pricing tiers set at Free / $50/mo Volunteer / $149/mo Professional / Enterprise contract
  Reason: Volunteer undercuts CalTopo ($750/yr), Professional covers SOC 2 costs at ~34 customers, Enterprise uses contract model to recover FedRAMP costs

### Deviations From Plan
- None

### Known Issues / Open Items
- K9 search_type uses a CHECK constraint with a note to validate array contents at the API layer — PostgreSQL does not natively enforce array element values without a custom function. Claude Code must implement this validation in the Zod schema and API route for k9_units.
- HIPAA-scoped fields in `incident_subjects` (medical_notes, medications, known_conditions, emergency_contact_*) require column-level filtering at the API layer since PostgreSQL RLS cannot filter individual columns natively. Claude Code must implement a separate RPC or view that excludes these columns for non-medical roles.

### Environment Variables Added
- None yet — will be established in Session 1

### What To Do Next Session
Next: Initialize the Next.js project with the approved stack. Set up Supabase project, enable PostGIS, run the first migrations in dependency order (organizations through organization_members), configure Supabase Auth, implement RLS on the first two tables, and verify with a cross-org RLS test. Do not build any UI until the foundation migrations are verified.

### Definition of Done Status
- All DoD items — N/A: No application code built this session. DoD applies from Session 1 onward.
